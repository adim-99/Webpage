    <p class="boldify">Welcome to my humble, online abode.</p>
    <p>
      This is merely a rudimentary webpage that I have created harnessing HTML
      and CSS to showcase my adeptness and adroit prowess in front-end
      development. Moreover, this page was also manifested to mitigate the stigma that I
      only flourish in the back-end realm, drowning in a deluge of convoluted
      data structures and algorithms. It need not any astute observations to
      discover this.

      Although this site may not be a reflection of the blood, sweat and tears
      that often incarnadine the markings of my work, it is a lucid indication
      of my capacity for ingenuity, evidenced via the sundry scatterings of
      markup mastery. Like an empty canvas, patiently awaiting its initial
      stroke of paint, this site in due time will burgeon into the 'Mona Lisa'
      of the digital world, swiftly attaining universal acclaim.

      The inner machinations of my mind, perpetually wavering between the
      ordinary and transmundane, are firmly rooted in the prolific aphorism
      (crafted by yours truly): <em>"Smart&nbsp;Thinking"</em>. The adage will
      indefinitely transcend time, as will this meagre webpage, perenially
      transgressing zeitgeists and contextual barriers for aeons ahead. For thou
      shall not envisage the inevitable, for it is but a futile endeavour.
